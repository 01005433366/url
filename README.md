This repository hosts the [URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `url.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments" here (I
know). Also, the URL Standard uses [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to generate
`url.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need to
contain the generated HTML.)

### Tests

Tests can be found in the `url/` directory of
[`w3c/web-platform-tests`](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
